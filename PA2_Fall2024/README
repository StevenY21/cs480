Summary: I used the given shapes (cones, cylinders, and spheres) to create a model that is loosely based off a scorpion. it has 6 one-jointed
legs and a 5-jointed tail, and the body is split into 3 parts with 3 joints, with one of the joints connected to head. The head and joints are spheres, the body and tail parts are cylinders, and the tail has a cone for a stinger.
Due to how scorpion body parts are connected, making clean joints proved really difficult, and is not as smooth as I would like.

KeyBinds:
a: joint0
s: joint1
d: joint2
f: joint3
g: joint4
h: joint5
j: joint6
joints 7-11 are less visible, as I tred to make the tail more seamless
k: joint7
l: joint8
A: joint9
S: joint10
D: bodyJoint1
F: bodyJoint2
G: headJoint
