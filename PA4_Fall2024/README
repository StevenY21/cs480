Summary: For the shapes, I used parametric equations for the specific shapes to get the xyz coordinates for each vertex. 
I used the cross product of the partial derivatives of the parametrics to get the surface normals.
The shapes are divided along horizontal and vertical parts, and that concept is applied in the nested loops for generating the vertices.
The vertices are stored in nested arrays, where each row is a vertex.
The indices are stored in nest arrays, with each row being 3 numbers that form a triangle that generates the shape. All the shapes have layers, so the triangles 
usually have indices of vertices in another "layer" to ensure it all connects to each other. 
The lighting followed the general illumination model provided in class. Keybinds can enable and disable specific light types and sources, as they modify
attributes in the shader program, which would then modify the results produced.

NOTE: For some reason, DisplayableCylinder.py might be lowercased when you get download and access it, make sure it says DisplayableCylinder before running code.
