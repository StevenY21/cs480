Summary: Made a predator model based on my previous assignment model, and a prey model based on a jellyfish. The models have movable legs,
with the predator model having movable body joints. If a predator gets within the bounding box of a prey, the prey will disappear from the tank. 
The creatures will "bounce" off each other if collision with bounding boxes/spheres occur. relationship
Known Error(s):
Unbound error for prey after predator kills prey.
